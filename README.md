<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Kindness First Penguin is a chrome extension that takes in users' texts.
Kindness First Penguin analyzes the texts and changes its states based on sentiment polarity of the texts. Users can also feed Kindness First Penguin, and Kindness First Penguin's mood will improve. The visual image of Kindness First Penguin raises awareness of users' mood states, and it encourages users to talk more constructively rather than resorting to toxic behaviors on the Internet. Most importantly, Kindness First Penguin helps people practice positive self-talk, check-in with their feelings, be grateful, and even perform small acts of kindness. 

Positive talk and a more optimistic outlook can have health benefits such as:
* greater satisfaction in life 
* reduced stress
* better physical well-being
* increased vitality 

We hope Kindness First Penguin gives you positive affirmations and identify negative talks. Surround yourself with positive people!
